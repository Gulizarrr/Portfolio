# Personal Portfolio (GitHub Pages)

This is a minimal portfolio site for **Gülüzar Durmaz**, built to be hosted on GitHub Pages.

## How to use

1. Create a public repository named `<your-username>.github.io` on GitHub.
2. Upload `index.html` and `style.css` from this folder to the repo (or drag-and-drop via GitHub web UI).
3. Commit the files. GitHub Pages will publish your site at `https://<your-username>.github.io`.
4. Edit the content:
   - In `index.html`, update your links (GitHub, LinkedIn, Email, CV).
   - In the `projects` array inside the `<script>` tag, add your projects (title, description, tags, link).
   - Update the tagline and availability text in the header.

## Tips for recruiters
- Keep the top section focused: role target + location + availability.
- Put 2–6 of your best projects with clear "View" links.
- Add a PDF CV named `CV.pdf` to the repository root to make the "Download CV" button work.
- Use GitHub Insights to see traffic to your repo.

## Optional improvements
- Add a custom domain in **Repo → Settings → Pages → Custom domain**.
- Add Google Analytics using a simple `<script>` in `index.html` (optional).
- Add a `favicon.ico` for a nicer tab icon.
